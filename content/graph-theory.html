<definition title="Graph">
  <p>
    A <em>(undirected) graph</em> is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising a set $V$ of <em>vertices</em> or <em>nodes</em> together with a set $E \subseteq V \times V$ of edges.

<definition title="Directed graph">
  <p>
    A <em>directed graph</em> is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising a set $V$ of vertices together with a set of $E$ edges. An edge $e \in E$ is an ordered pair of two verticies.
