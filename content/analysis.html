<definition title="Space">
  <p>
    A <em>space</em> is a set equipped with some structure. The elements of the space are called <em>points</em>.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Metric">
  <p>
    A <em>metric</em> (aka <em>distance function</em>) $d$ on a set $X$ is a symmetric function $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x, y, z \in X$ the following holds.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$ (identity of indiscernibles)</li>
    <li>$d(x, y) + d(y, z) \ge d(x, z)$ (triangle inequality or subadditivity)</li>
  </ul>
</definition>

<definition title="Metric space">
  <p>
    A <em>metric space</em> is a set equipped with a metric. We write $(X, d_X)$ for a metric space with underlying set $X$ and metric $d_X$.
  </p>
</definition>

<example>
  <p>
    The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with $d(x, y) = |x - y|$ is a metric space.

<h2>Infinite processes and limits</h2>

<definition title="Sequence" tag="definition-sequence">
  <p>A sequence is one of the following.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <em>finite sequence</em> is a function defined on $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ for some $n$.</li>
    <li>An <em>infinite sequence</em> is a function defined on $\mathbb{Z}_+ = \{1, 2, \ldots\}$.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If $a$ is a sequence we use the notation $a_k \coloneqq a(k)$. Similarly, we say that $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence. Note that we can shift the indices, in this way we say that also $(a_n)_\mathbb{N}$ is a sequence. If we do not care about the domain of the sequence, we simply write $(a_n)_n$.</p>
</definition>

<definition title="Cauchy sequence" tag="definition-cauchy-sequence">
  <p>
    Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. A <em>Cauchy sequence</em> in $X$ is a sequence $(x_n)_\mathbb{N}$ such that
    $$ \forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : n, m > N \implies d(x_n, x_m) \lt \epsilon.$$
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Limit of sequence">
  <p>
    The limit $L$ of a sequence $(a_n)_n$ is such that
    $$ \forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : n > N \implies d(x_n, L) \lt \epsilon.$$
    If a sequence has a limit, the sequence is said to be <em>convergent</em>, otherwise <em>divergent</em>.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Completeness">
  <p>
    A metric space is <em>complete</em> if all Cauchy sequences converge to an element in the space.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Limit of function">
  <p>
    Let $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a function. The <em>limit</em> $L$ of $f$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is denoted by
    $$ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L. $$
    The limit satisfies
    $$
    \begin{gathered}
      \forall \epsilon \gt 0 \; \exists \delta \gt 0 : \forall x \in X : \\
      d_X(x, c) \lt \delta \implies d_Y(f(x), L) \lt \epsilon.
    \end{gathered}
    $$
  </p>
</definition>

<remark>
  <p>
    The definition of a limit of a sequence is recovered from the definition of a limit of a function by choosing $X = \mathbb{N}$ and $c = \infty$.
  </p>
</remark>

<definition title="Continuous function" tag="definition-continuous-function">
  <p>
    A function $f: X \to Y$ is continuous at a point $c$ if
    $$ \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c). $$
    A function is said to be <em>continuous</em> if it is continuous at every point in the domain.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Derivative">
  <p>
    The <em>derivative</em> at $c$ of a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is
    $$ f'(c) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}. $$
    The function is said to be <em>differentiable</em> at $c$.
  </p>
  <p>
    A function that is said to be <em>differentiable</em> if it is differentiable at every point in the domain, in this case the derivative of $f$ is viewed as a function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeatedly differentiating a function $k$ times gives rise to the $k$:th derivative, denoted $f^{(k)}$, if it exists.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Continuously differentiable">
  <p>
    A function is <em>continuously differentiable</em> the function if differentiable and the derivative is a continuous function.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Smooth function">
  <p>
    A function is <em>smooth</em> if it is infinitely continuously differentiable, i.e. if $f^{(k)}$ is continuously differentiable for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
  </p>
</definition>

<definition title="Set of differentiable functions">
  <p>
    The set of $k$ times continuously differentiable functions is denoted $C^k(\mathbb{R})$. The set of smooth functions is denoted $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.
  </p>
