  <em>An experiment in combining a formal and an intuitive approach to mathematics. Source on <a href="https://github.com/ViktorQvarfordt/math-ebook">GitHub</a>.</em>

<p>
  This text is designed to be read on a computer, mobile device or e-reader, <em>not</em> on paper. References are hyperlinks, in this way no numbering is needed like when typesetting PDFs with LaTeX. Explanations intended to help develop the intuition can be toggled and hidden as to not distract the more advanced reader. In this way, terse and dry formalism is combined with lengthy and intuitive explanations in a way that is not possible in a physical book.

<h1>Terminology and nomenclature</h1>

<p>
  A list of important symbols etc will <em>not</em> be listed here since this can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols">elsewhere</a>. Throughout the text terms will be defined and introduced before use.
</p>
<p>
  A list of important words that are used to convey technical meaning is given below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
