    The vector space $‚Ñù^n$ can be viewed in two ways:
  </p>
  <ul class="inline">
    <li><em>Space:</em> Elements of $‚Ñù^n$ are seen as as points in space, whose only property is location, expressed by the coordinates $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$.</li>
    <li><em>Directions:</em> Elements of $‚Ñù^n$ are seen as vectors, which are objects that have direction and magnitude, but whose location is irrelevant.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Based on this idea we introduce the following definition.
  </p>
  <definition inline>
    Let $a ‚àà ‚Ñù^n$, the <strong>geometric tangent space to $‚Ñù^n$ at $a$</strong> is $‚Ñù^n_a = \{a\} \times ‚Ñù^n$.
  </definition>
  <p>
    In this way $‚Ñù^n_a$ and $‚Ñù^n_b$ are distinct. Think of $‚Ñù^n_a$ as the vector space $‚Ñù^n$ with origin at $a$.

    Consider a manifold embedded in an ambient space, for example $ùïä^2 \subset ‚Ñù^3$. The tangent space to $ùïä^2$ at a point $a$ is then simply the subspace of $‚Ñù^3_a$ that is orthogonal to the line containing $0$ and $a$.
